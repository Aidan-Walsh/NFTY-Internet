# NFTY-Internet


Welcome! This repository contains my work and research performed during my senior year at Princeton. For this project, I assisted Maria Apostolaki (Professor at Princeton University) and Aqsa Kashaf (was a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University) in their research project: Network Function Capacity Reconnaisance by Remote Adversaries. In short, this research project looks at a novel method that is able to accurately, quickly, efficiently, and quietly infer the processing capacity (how fast) of a Network Function (server/device that manages information entering a network). This method is called Network Function capaciTY estimation (NFTY). My contribution is that I perform experiments over the Internet and verify that the proposed method works when packets are sent across the Internet. Refer to written_final_report.pdf for the in-depth documentation, steps, background, and results.
